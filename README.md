wormplayer
==========

wormplayer version 0.1

worm player is an muti-media player based on SDL and ffmpeg. i may use QT to code UI in the future。it is now
fairly simple. I think i will keep on improving it. 
hope u like it！ 

if u want to use this. you need to build ffmpeg static library  first. 
And if you want to run it on linux . you need to install SDL.

In linux:
press space to pause 
press -> to skip ahead 
press <- to skip back
press x button to close
